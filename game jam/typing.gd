	"Wow! How interesting! I'm studying Business.",'Oh wow! That pairs well with Game Design!',
	'Yeah...sure. So, what do you like to do in your free time?','Oh where to start, I like Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, building the Gravity Device, reading, and competitive programming!',
	'Huh, interesting. And where are you from?',"I'm from Parker's Crossroads, Tennessee, but you're the only ten I see! *Ahem* It's a small town...",
	"Oh. So that's why you're such a silly little guy. So what's it like living in a small town?",'We have a canon!',
	'Just...in a field?',"Uhm, yeah. It's just in a field, in the middle of town, and you can see it from anywhere in town! It's really cool!",
	'How quaint! That\'s just like the war from my home!','Pardon?','Nothing, nothing! So, Dungeons & Dragons, eh? What got you into that?',
	'Oh I\'m SO glad you asked! Well, it all started when my dad DM\'ed a session in fourth grade and I died. Well, I didn\'t realize I had actually died until years later.',
	'Ah I see. So you\'re...dead?','No, no! The character I played died, not me. What about you though? What are you into?',
	"I\'m a bit of a collector, I collect silly little guys.",'WHAT?!','Bugs, silly! I collect...bugs.',
	'Oh, ok. I thought, since you said I was a silly little guy before...','You\'re just imagining things.',
	'The only thing I\'m imagining is you next to me at the altar.','Ughhhhhhh, I lost my number, can I have yours?',
	"(509) 369-6420. Would you like to go on another date? Y\'know, since you asked for my number and everything...",

	"He certainly must be one in a krillion. Haha!","He's a silly little guy, if you will. Another for your collection, although he isn't a bug.",
	"Another one for my collection indeed!","Haha, yeah! Do you have a favorite species of fish?",

	"What kind of bugs do you collect?","All types honestly, small, big, and medium sized.","That's so cool! Well, when do you wanna meet next?",
	"Let's do an arcade night tomorrow! How does that sound?","Alright let's meet up at 7:30, does that work?",
